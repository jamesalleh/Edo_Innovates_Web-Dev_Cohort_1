  Rising in the center of Paris, the Eiffel Tower is the most recognizable landmark and is the best spot day or night to get an expansive view of the city. There are two levels that you can access via elevator. Level two gives visitors a view from 200 feet and is a shorter ride to its observation level. However, the best view and your best bet is to make sure you purchase tickets that take you to level three, which rises approximately 1,000 feet above the City of Lights. The Eiffel Tower tends to be one of the most crowded attractions in Paris so be sure to purchase skip-the-line tickets in advance to maximize your time.
