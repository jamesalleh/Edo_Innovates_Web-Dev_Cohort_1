          <h3>Located in northern France, Giverny is just above Paris to the northwest in the Eure, a French department thats located in the Upper Normandy region. More often than not linked to Monet's house, to art and to lyricism, its easy to forget that Giverny is first and foremost a municipal town that lays claim to its own history. <br>

            Long before one of the most admired painters in the world decided to make this peaceful town his principal residence and place of inspiration, Giverny had already possessed a charm that attracted artists and city-folk in search of some R&R. <br>
            
            Giverny owes its name to its Latin counterpart, Giverniacum, which dates back to almost 1,600 years. The very first historical traces of Giverny go back to the Merovingian era (481-575 AD) when Charles II the Bald officially recognized and thereby gave possession of Giverny to monks ordained at the Saint-Denis-le-Ferment Abbey.</h3>

          <h3>It's hard not to think of France without thinking of its most famous artist, Claude Monet. Located about 45 miles west outside of Paris in the French countryside, Monet's Giverny includes the charming home of Monet, complete with the real pond and the water lilies that were the inspiration for Monet's most celebrated impressionist work of art, Water Lilies. </h3>
