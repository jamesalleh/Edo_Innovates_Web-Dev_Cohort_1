          <h3>Montmartre was an independent commune located just outside Paris until 1860, when it became the eighteenth district of Paris. <br> At the end of the nineteenth century, the neighborhood was avoided by many Parisians due to the cabarets and brothels that opened in the area. <br> However, many famous artists decided to live in the area during the Belle Époque, transforming it into the unique and surprising district it is today.</h3>

          <h3>There are numerous churches and chapels in Paris, and among the most iconic is Sacré-Cœur, located in Montmartre in the18th arrondissement.  The basilica stands on the highest point of the city at the top of a series of steps, rising above the artists in the street. It is hard to miss with its white dome. </h3>
