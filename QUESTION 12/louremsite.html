          <h3>The Louvre was originally built as a fortress in 1190, but was reconstructed in the 16th century to serve as a royal palace. "Like many buildings, it was built and rebuilt over the years," said Tea Gudek Snajdar, an Amsterdam-based art historian, museum docent and a blogger at Culture Tourist. 
            <br>
            During its time as a royal residence, the Louvre saw tremendous growth. Nearly every monarch expanded it, according to History.com. Today, it covers a total area of 652,300 square feet (60,600 square meters). In 1682, Louis XIV moved the royal residence to Versailles, and the Louvre became home to various art academies, offering regular exhibitions of its members' works.</h3>

          <h3>Perhaps one of the most famous art museums in France and the world is the Louvre Museum. Dating to the 12th century, the Louvre was constructed as a fortress and was later converted to a palace during the 16th century. <br>

            It became an art museum in 1793. Today, Paris Louvre houses over 35,000 works of art, including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, Michelangelo's Dying Slave and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. </h3>
