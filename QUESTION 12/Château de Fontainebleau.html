          <h3>The historic Château de Fontainebleau was first built in the twelfth century as a hunting lodge for the French kings, but fell into disrepair by the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century King Francois I orchestrated its restoration and it was transformed into the castle we know today. This residence has been a base for the French royal family  particularly its kings since its humble beginnings as a hunting lodge, and is known to have been a favourite dwelling of King Henri II, King Henri IV and Napoleon Bonaparte.</h3>
