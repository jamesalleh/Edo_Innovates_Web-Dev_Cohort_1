          <h3>The most popular tourist place in Paris has stretched to the Parisian skies for 127 years. Although now symbolic of France, it wasn't meant to last. Without a doubt, the turning point in the Eiffel Tower history took place at the 1889 Universal Exposition. In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution, a competition was organized with the aim to “build on the Champ-de-Mars an iron tower with a square base, 125 meters wide and 300 meters high.” Out of the 107 proposals submitted, Gustave Eiffel's was chosen. By his side were engineers Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier as well as architect Stephen Sauvestre</h3>

          <h3>Rising in the center of Paris, the Eiffel Tower is the most recognizable landmark and is the best spot day or night to get an expansive view of the city. There are two levels that you can access via elevator. Level two gives visitors a view from 200 feet and is a shorter ride to its observation level. However, the best view and your best bet is to make sure you purchase tickets that take you to level three, which rises approximately 1,000 feet above the City of Lights. The Eiffel Tower tends to be one of the most crowded attractions in Paris so be sure to purchase skip-the-line tickets in advance to maximize your time.</h3>
