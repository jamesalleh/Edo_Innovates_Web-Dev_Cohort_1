          <h3>The Moulin Rouge went through several periods of transformation, from cabaret to theatre, and from cinema to music-hall with dancers popping out of cakes. The Moulin Rouge is a living legend that was built over the decades. <br> Although it's extremely well-known throughout the world, certain parts of its history remain less known to the public. <br> For more than 120 years, the Moulin Rouge has been one of the nerve centers of Montmartre. Here is a history of this Parisian institution that now welcomes nearly 600,000 visitors every year.</h3>

          <h3>Moulin Rouge is a not-to-be-missed Parisian experience. The can-can dance was born at the Moulin Rouge but it's the cabaret shows at the Moulin Rouge that are the main attraction. The shows are considered family-friendly by Parisian standards, with a minimum age of 6 for admission and a dress code that excludes flip flops or shorts. </h3>
