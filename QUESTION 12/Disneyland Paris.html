            In 1992, Disney magic came to Europe with the opening of Euro Disney, a theme park that would grow to become today's Disneyland® Paris.
            
            The last 30 years have seen more than 250 million visitors step through the gates of Disneyland® Park, and we believe it's just as magical today as it was back then.</h3>

          <h3>
            Whether you are a Disney fan or not, this park with a French flair has specific attractions that you can't see in the United States theme parks in Florida or California. Catch a wave on Crush's Coaster from the film, “Finding Nemo” or have a rat's eye view into Ratatouille: The Adventure ride. </h3>
