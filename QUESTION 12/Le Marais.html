          <h3>Located in the 3rd and 4th arrondissements in Paris and on the right bank of the Seine River, Le Marais was home to Paris aristocrats for centuries. After several decades of decay, it has experienced a return to its original splendor and architectural brilliance. Today, it boasts some of the best restaurants and boutiques in Paris.</h3>
