          <h3>In 1623, the Ch√¢teau de Versailles was far from being the baroque architectural masterpiece that it is today with over 800 hectares and 2,300 rooms. Before settling in the Yvelines, all kings resided at the Louvre Palace, now the famous museum. The former childhood bedroom of Louis XIV has been transformed into a museum.</h3>
